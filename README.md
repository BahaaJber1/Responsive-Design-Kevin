# Respoinsive Design by Kevin Powell 

## Here I'll be putting all the extra information about the challenges or the things I learn

1. Challenge 01

This challenge talks about how the web is **ALREADY** respoinsive, we just make it behave otherwise using css.
And here's the problem if you want to keep things responsive avoide using units like **px**, instead use **[%, em, rem]**, and **DON'T** use heights for fun just keep the content take its height.
